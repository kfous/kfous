My name is Konstantinos, and I'm a Copmputer Scientist focusing on AI/ML engineering. I have more than 4 years of experience building software to solve exciting and sometimes hard problems.

I deeply care about unlocking the power of technology and innovation for individual and businesses, to upgrade their product and processes in the most efficient way.
I find joy in ambiguity and feel more engaged when working on problems that I haven't experienced before.
